#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Software engineering involves writing code, building apps, games and websites and problem solving which make life easier. 
  Software engineering is important as it enables software application creation that affect crucial aspects of modern life such as communication, entertainment, commerce, education and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Development of programming languages- The development of programming languages such as Fortran and C was a great milestone in software engineering.
  Establishment of software engineering as a discipline- This was in the 1960s where software engineering could not be independently studied and pursued.
  The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s- This methodology encouraged flexibility in software development and hence a major milestone.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Planning-This is the phase where define the project goals, set timeliness, create a budget and assign roles to your team.
  Design-This is where you design how the software will work in terms of user friendliness, visual appeal and technical architecture of how everything will fit together.
  Development-This is the third phase where you write the code to bring the project to life.
  Testing-This is the phase where you test the functionality of the software created so as to find bugs and ensure everything works as expected.
  Deployment-This is where the software is put to live and users can start using the software.
  Maintenance-This is where you keep the software running smoothly. It is a post-launch phase where you can fix bugs, add new features and keep things up to date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall- This is type of methodology which is more like a linear flow where one step finishes before the next step starts. It is suitable where the project is clear, precise and unlikely to change. An example where this method is suitable is when constructing a building.
  Agile-This is the type of methodology which is more flexible, adaptable to change and emphasises on working in small iterations called sprints. It is suitable where the project is open to frequent updates, frequent feature additions and rapid time to market is crucial. Example where this method is suitable is when developing a new mobile application.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software developer-A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing sofware solutions.
  Quality Assuarance Engineer-A quality assuarance manager is responsible for software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  Project Manager-The work of a project manager is to oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are important as they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples of IDEs include Visual Code and Eclipse.
  Version Control Systems (VCS) are important as they are software tools that are responsible for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Tight deadlines-Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. 
  Changing requirements-requirements may change in the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays.
  Technical debt-This may accrue as a result from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions. Technical debts can impede future developments efforts and increase maintenance costs. 
  These challenges can be overcomed by effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessments of project goals and timeliness.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit Testing-This involves testing of individual components or modules of software
  Integration Testing-This is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  System Testing-This is testing the whole software as a whole.
  Acceptance Testing-This is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  These control measures such as code reviews, automated and manual testing and continuous integration helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to high quality software products.
  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt Engineering involves crafuing questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
  Prompt engineering is important as it helps avoid getting confusing answers as it enables the questions to be clear and specific and makes AI understand exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  An example of a vague prompt is "Tell me about dogs". 
  An example of a clear, specific and concise prompt is "Tell me about the history of dogs".
  The vague prompt provides a general response while a clear and concise prompt provides a more focused response. It also improves humans interaction with AI as AI understands the request better.
